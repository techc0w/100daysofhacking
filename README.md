# About my 100 Days Of Hacking progress

Hello! I decided to create this file as my way of logging my progress. It has been long overdue and I felt it was time for me to show what I've learned so far related to cybersecurity, as well as share my thoughts about other learning resources.

I started diving into cybersecurity as of November 2022. Currently, I'm learning through TryHackMe. I'm also enrolled in the Google IT Support Professional certification path as I want to fine tune my current technical support skills, as well as go over topics that I may have missed out at the time I did my college degree in IT. 

Thank you for being part of my journey! You can follow me on Mastodon at https://techhub.social/@techc0w

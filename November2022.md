## Day 1 (November 26, 2022)

Enrolled in the Pre-Security path on tryhackme.com and so far, am loving the hands on lessons. Understanding the differences between offensive and defensive teams.

## Day 2 (November 27, 2022)

Enrolled in the Technical Support Fundamentals course for the Google IT Support Professional certification path. Was able to finished week 1. Looking forward to starting week 2. 

Started the network fundamentals section on TryHackMe to refresh up on networking and LAN. 

So far, itâ€™s been great in getting back to these topics that Iâ€™ve previously forgotten. Canâ€™t wait to learn more ðŸ˜Š

## Day 3 (November 28, 2022)

Finished the Network Fundamentals section on TryHackMe. Moving forward to the "How The Web Works" module.

Started Week 2 of the Technical Support Fundamentals course. 

It was great to get a refresher on the network basics and understand the different layers in the OSI model.


## Day 4 (November 29, 2022)

Was able to finish the Web module on TryHackMe (understanding requests, DNS, etc.). Continued with Week 2 of the Technical Support Fundamental course. 

The Web module was fun to do, especially in learning about HTML injection. Iâ€™m familiar with SQL injection, so it was nice to have more understanding on how itâ€™s done.

## Day 5 (November 30, 2022)

Was able to finish the Linux fundamentals portion via TryHackMe and I had so much fun relearning the commands. Also learned a bit more on cron.

I also did the practice quiz for week 2 of Technical Support Fundamentals course related to computer hardware.

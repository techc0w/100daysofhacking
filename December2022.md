# Day 6 (December 1)

Enrolled in the Advent of Cyber 2022 course via TryHackMe and completed day 1 task - Frameworks:Someone's coming to town! Completed the Pre-Security path on the website as well. Will be starting the Introduction to Cyber Security path tomorrow.

Also was able to start the Components section within the Technical Support course.

Feeling great now that I've been getting into the routine of setting time aside for learning.

Also, I miss using Linux! So glad I was able to reacquaint myself on the OS once more.

# Day 7 (December 2)

Started the Intro To Cybersecurity path on TryHackMe as well as did the day 2 task (Log Analysis: Santa's Naughty & Nice Log) for the Advent of Cyber 2022 event.

More lessons for Week Two of the Technical Support Fundamentals course.

# Day 8 (December 3)

Was able to complete day 3 task from the Advent of Cyber 2022 event from TryHackMe (OSINT: Nothing escapes detective McRed).

Finished the Intro To Cyber Security learning path and currently looking into Web Fundamentals, SOC Level 1 and CompTIA Pentest+ paths.

Also did more lessons on Week 2 portion of the Technical Support Fundamentals course. 

Been a long day, so time to take a nap!

# Day 9 (December 4)

Was able to complete the Day 4 task (Scanning: Scanning through the snow) for the Advent of Cyber 2022 event via TryHackMe.

Began starting the Web Fundamentals learning path on the site as well.

# Day 10 (December 5)

Was able to complete Day 5 task from TryHackMe for the Advent of Cyber 2022 event (Brute-Forcing: He knows when you're awake).

This was my first time having hands-on experience with brute force attacks so it was nice to have the exposure.

Finally managed to complete the Components section from Week 2 of the Technical Support Fundamentals course. 

Lots of learning, but it's been keeping me busy as the weather gets colder.

# Day 11 (December 6)

There was a hiccup on the Advent of Cyber 2022 event where the progress was resetted. I ended up redoing all of them while they were waiting to get it fixed. 

Was able to complete the Day 6 task (Email Analysis: It's beginning to look a lot like phishing). 

Also completed another module in the Web Fundamentals learning path.

# Day 12 (December 7)

Was able to complete the Day 7 task from the Advent of Cyber 2022 event via TryHackMe (Cyberchef: Maldocs roasting on an open fire). It was fun learning how CyberChef operates and helped me understand how to defang URLs.

Also completed anotheer module on the Web Fundamentals path.

# Day 13 (December 8)

Completed the Day 8 Advent of Cyber 2022 task via TryHackMe (Smart Contracts: Last Christmas I gave you my ETH). Have to admit, this one I struggled a bit since I never really saw the appeal on cryptocurrency. But it was interesting to learn more about how it functions and how smart contracts are involved.

Also halfway done with my Week 2 learning for the Technical Support Fundamentals course.

# Day 14 (December 9)

This was such a difficult but exciting task! Day 9 of the Advent of Cyber event focused on Metasploit and pivoting. I had to rewatch the video a couple of times before I was able to grasp the concept. It was also awesome to get first hand exposure in using Kali Linux. 

The good news is that I finished the Week 2 lesson and did my assessment for the Technical Support Fundamentals course.

# Day 15 (December 10)

Now this task got interesting (Hack a game: You're a mean one, Mr. Yeti).

For the Day 10 task, I learned how to use Cetus which was a browser plugin to explore the memory space of Web Assembly games. Editing the hexadecimals on some parts in the game reminded me of the days when I used Game Shark to make edits on the codes in a simliar format.

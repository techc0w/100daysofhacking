# Day 6 (December 1)

Enrolled in the Advent of Cyber 2022 course via TryHackMe and completed day 1 task - Frameworks:Someone's coming to town! Completed the Pre-Security path on the website as well. Will be starting the Introduction to Cyber Security path tomorrow.

Also was able to start the Components section within the Technical Support course.

Feeling great now that I've been getting into the routine of setting time aside for learning.

Also, I miss using Linux! So glad I was able to reacquaint myself on the OS once more.

# Day 7 (December 2)

Started the Intro To Cybersecurity path on TryHackMe as well as did the day 2 task (Log Analysis: Santa's Naughty & Nice Log) for the Advent of Cyber 2022 event.

More lessons for Week Two of the Technical Support Fundamentals course.

# Day 8 (December 3)

Was able to complete day 3 task from the Advent of Cyber 2022 event from TryHackMe (OSINT: Nothing escapes detective McRed).

Finished the Intro To Cyber Security learning path and currently looking into Web Fundamentals, SOC Level 1 and CompTIA Pentest+ paths.

Also did more lessons on Week 2 portion of the Technical Support Fundamentals course. 

Been a long day, so time to take a nap!

# Day 9 (December 4)

Was able to complete the Day 4 task (Scanning: Scanning through the snow) for the Advent of Cyber 2022 event via TryHackMe.

Began starting the Web Fundamentals learning path on the site as well.

# Day 10 (December 5)

Was able to complete Day 5 task from TryHackMe for the Advent of Cyber 2022 event (Brute-Forcing: He knows when you're awake).

This was my first time having hands-on experience with brute force attacks so it was nice to have the exposure.

Finally managed to complete the Components section from Week 2 of the Technical Support Fundamentals course. 

Lots of learning, but it's been keeping me busy as the weather gets colder.

# Day 11 (December 6)

There was a hiccup on the Advent of Cyber 2022 event where the progress was resetted. I ended up redoing all of them while they were waiting to get it fixed. 

Was able to complete the Day 6 task (Email Analysis: It's beginning to look a lot like phishing). 

Also completed another module in the Web Fundamentals learning path.

# Day 12 (December 7)

Was able to complete the Day 7 task from the Advent of Cyber 2022 event via TryHackMe (Cyberchef: Maldocs roasting on an open fire). It was fun learning how CyberChef operates and helped me understand how to defang URLs.

Also completed anotheer module on the Web Fundamentals path.

# Day 13 (December 8)

Completed the Day 8 Advent of Cyber 2022 task via TryHackMe (Smart Contracts: Last Christmas I gave you my ETH). Have to admit, this one I struggled a bit since I never really saw the appeal on cryptocurrency. But it was interesting to learn more about how it functions and how smart contracts are involved.

Also halfway done with my Week 2 learning for the Technical Support Fundamentals course.

# Day 14 (December 9)

This was such a difficult but exciting task! Day 9 of the Advent of Cyber event focused on Metasploit and pivoting. I had to rewatch the video a couple of times before I was able to grasp the concept. It was also awesome to get first hand exposure in using Kali Linux. 

The good news is that I finished the Week 2 lesson and did my assessment for the Technical Support Fundamentals course.

# Day 15 (December 10)

Now this task got interesting (Hack a game: You're a mean one, Mr. Yeti).

For the Day 10 task, I learned how to use Cetus which was a browser plugin to explore the memory space of Web Assembly games. Editing the hexadecimals on some parts in the game reminded me of the days when I used Game Shark to make edits on the codes in a simliar format. 

# Day 16 (December 11)

Day 11 task from Advent of Cyber via TryHackMe focused on Memory Forensics. It was straightforward and I liked how it broke down the different plugins used when scanning the files. 

Also halfway done with the Week 3 module from the Technical Support Fundamentals course. Super happy of the progress and am actually enjoying the work.

# Day 17 (December 12)

Today was super tiring due to work. But I managed to complete Day 12 task from the Advent of Cyber via TryHackMe, which focused on Malware Analysis. I'm not a huge fan of using Windows,but it was good to see the different scripts used within FLARE VM. Using the Proccess Monitor Filter as well as the Detect it Easy tool was new to me. 

Also finished the rest of the videos from the Week 3 module from the Technical Support Fundamentals course. Just need to do the graded assessments.

# Day 18 (December 13)

Day 13 task from the Advent of Cyber event from TryHackMe focused on Packet Analysis. By far, one of my favorites as I've worked with Wireshark in the past. So, this was a great way to refresh myself on the tool, as well as how one can learn to detect anomalities in the network and view the logs with more insight. 

Finally finished the assessments for Week 3 of the Technical Support Fundamentals course. Time to move onto the next module.

# Day 19 (December 14)

Day 14 task from the Advent of Cyber event from TryHackMe focused on Web Applications. It was nice to get a recap on understanding how they work, as well as understand OWASP Top 10 and IDOR. This one was pretty easy to do as I was able to figure out how to adjust the URL by changing the ID numbers.

Also started going through the Week 4 module for the Technical Support Fundamentals course.

# Day 20 (December 15)

Day 15 task from the Advent of Cyber event from TryHackMe focused on Secure Coding. This was the first time I heard about Purple Teams so this topic falled under this scope. It covered topics related to input validation of file upload functionality, unrestricted file upload vunerabilites, phishing through file uploads, and how to properly secure file upload functionality. Going through the task and being able to load a suspicious file into the input form while running the server and gaining access to their computer was thrilling. But also scary since now it made me more aware of the downloads I get online to ensure that this doesn't happen to me. 

Sadly, I couldn't do any lessons from the Technical Support Fundamentals course since work was extremely busy (holiday projects are not so fun).

# Day 21 (December 16)

Day 16 task from the Advent of Cyber event from TryHackMe focused on another Purple Team topic, which was on SQL injections. I love using SQL, so this was a great way to get more exposure related to how it works. Still rusty on PHP, but this was a good refresher.

# Day 22 (December 17)

Day 17 task from the Advent of Cyber event from TryHackMe focused on another Purple Team topic which was input validation, HTML5 and Regex. I have to admit, I'm not familiar with Regex in terms of application. It took a while for me to grasp the concept, but I maange to complete the task after rereading the instructions.

# Day 23 (December 18)

Day 18 task from the Advent of Cyber event from TryHackMe focused on how to use Sigma and understanding Sigma rules. To be honest, this was not my favorite task to do as it was hard to understand the task. Even after watching the video, I was a bit lost. 

# Day 24 (December 19)

Day 19 task from the Advent of Cyber event from TryHackMe focused on hardware hacking. Since this was a Red Team topic, it peaked my interest. It was a good way to learn about how data is sent via electrial wires in low-level hardware, communication protocols and how to analyze them, and learning how to read USART data from a logic capture. Even though the task scratched the surface on hardware taking, it was mindblowing to see how one can read the data when viewing it at a careful inspection.

# Day 25 (December 20)

Day 20 task from the Advent of Cyber event from TryHackMe focused on another Red Team topic, which was Firmware reverse engineering and analysis. This was interesting because it provided good exposure on what it's about, along with how to extract the code from the firmware, finding the hidden keys in encrypted hardware, and modifying / rebuilding the firmware.

# Day 26 (December 21)

Day 21 task from the Advent of Cyber event from TryHackMe focused on Messaging Protocols and Middleware. This task was fun as you're able to hack a webcam! It was a great way to understand IoT (Internet of Things) as well as using MQTT (in this case we used the mosquitto_sub client utility).
